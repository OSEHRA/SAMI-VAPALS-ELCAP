This project uses a git submodule for the docs/ directory, which is why it
doesn't seem like it works the same way as before.

Because docs/ is actually a separate repository than the main
repository, any changes to any files in docs/ should be committed and
pushed from the docs/ directory.

You will also have to commit those commits from the main repository.

From the main repository, this will appear if you have modified files
in the docs/ repository, or if they were modified in the upstream
repository:

    $ git status
    On branch master
    Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
    Changes not staged for commit:
      (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
      (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

            modified:   docs (new commits)

    no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
    $ _

You can see that the docs directory has "new commits," and it's these
that must be committed in the main project. If you use `git diff` to
see what those look like, it'll be something like this:

    $ git diff
    diff --git a/docs b/docs
    index f3d8538..bd28b1f 160000
    --- a/docs
    +++ b/docs

    +Subproject commit bd28b1f5e93a521f70a283dd91da9367108e39ac
    $ _

Just use `git pull`, `git add docs`, `git commit` and `git push` as
you might otherwise do, and the notice on the docs/ directory in `git
status` will go away.
