This project uses a git submodule for the docs/ directory, which is why it
doesn't seem like it works the same way as before.

Because docs/ is actually a separate repository than the main
repository, any changes to any files in docs/ should be committed and
pushed from that directory.

You will also have to commit those commits from the main repository.

    $ git status
    On branch master
    Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
    Changes not staged for commit:
      (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
      (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

            modified:   docs (new commits)

    no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
    $ _

You can see that the docs directory has "new commits,"

    $ git diff
    diff --git a/docs b/docs
