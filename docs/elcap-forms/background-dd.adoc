== VA-PALS — Background form (++sbform++) data dictionary

Last updated 2017-09-13 from the spreadsheet.

[options="compact"]
* The R column indicates whether or not the field is required. The default is
  ``not required.''
* The X column indicates whether or not the field is indexed. The default is
  ``not indexed.''
* The E column indicates whether or not the field is editable. The default is
  ``editable.''
* The # column indicates the field number and subfield number, delimited by the
  decimal point.
* In 16.8, ``e.g.'' should have a comma after it.
* The +sbfcs+ fields (32.*) have an erroneous subfield numbers in the
  spreadsheet (5 and 6 instead of 1 and 2).
* In 135.3, 135.4, 136.4 and 136.5, some spreadsheet shenanigans occurred in
  the descriptions. This is due to automatic date translation because the
  fields weren't specified as strings with an initial quote mark.
* In 148.1, the data type is RDATE; I don't actually know what that is.

Here's the link:background-dd.csv[data dictionary in CSV format], which you can
open in OpenOffice or Excel. (Tab and quote delimited.)

Here's the link:background-ddr.csv[corrected version in CSV format]. (Tab and
quote delimited.)

And here's link:background-dd-m.csv[Rick's Mumpsified version in CSV format],
kinda. (Caret and quote delimited, with no doubled quotes to escape a quote
mark.) It doesn't have the same information as the data dictionaries supplied
to use from the ELCAP team; this is much more application specific.
