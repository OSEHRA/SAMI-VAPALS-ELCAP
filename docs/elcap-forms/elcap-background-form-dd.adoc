== VA-PALS — Background form data dictionary

Last updated 2017-09-05 from the spreadsheet.

[options="compact"]
* The R column indicates whether or not the field is required.
* The X column indicates whether or not the field is indexed.
* The E column indicates whether or not the field is _not_ editable.
* The # column indicates the field number and subfield number, delimited by the
  decimal point.
* The field name for ``Patient Height'' (8.1) should be +sbph+.
* In 16.8, ``e.g.'' should have a comma after it.
* In 80.3, 80.4, 81.4, and 81.5, some spreadsheet shenanigans occurred in the
  descriptions.
* None of the fields from Page 3 of the Background Form appear (everything
  after ``Secondhand Tobacco Smoke Exposure / Occupation'').
