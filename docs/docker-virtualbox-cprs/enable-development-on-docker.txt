Altering one of our Docker containers for development -- enabling the ability to push to our repos -- is straightforward. You need make a few, simple changes as the osehra user.

Edit .bashrc.

    $ docker start vapals
    $ ssh -p 2222 root@localhost
    (password is "docker")
    $ oshera
    [osehra@vapals ~]$ vi .bashrc


    The file includes the following section:

    # Git
    export GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="Alexis Carlson"
    export GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="whatisthehumanspirit@gmail.com"
    export GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="Alexis Carlson"
    export GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="whatisthehumanspirit@gmail.com"

    Replace my Git credentials with your own.

Replace the private key named id_rsa with the one from Avicenna. The easiest way to do that is to replace the text of id_rsa on your Docker container with the text of id_rsa on Avicenna. Personally, I'd copy the public key (id_rsa.pub) over as well, just so the pair of files match.

    [osehra@vapals ~]$ vi .ssh/id_rsa
    
    In a separate session shell into Avicenna.
    
    $ ssh avicenna.vistaexpertise.net
    avicenna$ osehra
    avicenna$ cat .ssh/id_rsa
    
    You can just copy the output of the last command and paste it into vi on your Docker container.
    
I haven't actually tried this in while now, so please let me know if you have issues. I'll work with you to fix them.
