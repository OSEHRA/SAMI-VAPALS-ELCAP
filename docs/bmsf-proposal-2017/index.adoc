== Proposal Narrative

[[sect-1]]
=== 1. Organizational mission

The US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has been dedicated to improving the
care of patients with cancer for almost a century. This includes its commitment
to fund the first Tumor Research Laboratory at the Chicago Hines VA Hospital
in{nbsp}1932. It is notable that this scientific endeavor predated the
discovery of chemotherapy by more than a decade, and goes back to an era when
surgical techniques remained unsafe for many tumors.

Since that time, the VA has grown to become the nation’s largest integrated
healthcare system. It now provides a myriad of healthcare services for 9
million Veterans with a vast network of over 1,500 outpatient clinics to reach
all of its patients who live anywhere in the country. In addition, it continues
to dedicate resources to improve the outcomes of approximately 40,000 Veterans
who receive cancer care in the VA each year.footnoteref:["1","Zullig LL,
Jackson GL, Dorn RA, et{nbsp}al. Cancer incidence among patients of the
U.S. Veterans Affairs Health Care System. __Mil Med.__ 2012;177(6):693--701."]
This includes a focus on lung cancer since the 1960’s when the VA made a
significant early contribution to the literature regarding asymptomatic
solitary pulmonary nodules.footnoteref:["2","Steele JD. The Solitary Pulmonary
Nodule. Report of a Cooperative Study of Resected Asymptomatic Solitary
Pulmonary Nodules in Males. __J{nbsp}Thorac Cardiovasc Surg.__
1963;46:21--39."]

Today, the VA’s commitment to improving the outcomes for patients with lung
cancer is as strong as ever. This is exemplified by the following list of
recent high-level contributions to the field:

. A multi-site project funded by the VA Under Secretary of Health in 2012 to
evaluate the feasibility of a national lung cancer screening
program.footnoteref:["3","Kinsinger LS, Anderson C, Kim J, et{nbsp}al.

screening recommendation in health care: the Veterans Health Administration's
approach to lung cancer screening. __Ann Intern Med.__ 2014;161(8):597--598."]

. An evidence based review and recommendation, authored by VA investigators in
2013, to the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) that in 2014
endorsed lung cancer screening as a preventive service to reduce the risk of
lung cancer mortality. This VA contribution ultimately led to the approval of
coverage for annual lung cancer screening by the Centers for Medicare &
Medicaid Services.footnoteref:["5","Humphrey{nbsp}LL, Deffebach{nbsp}M,
Pappas{nbsp}M, et{nbsp}al. Screening for lung cancer with low-dose computed
tomography: a systematic review to update the US Preventive services task force
recommendation. __Ann Intern Med.__ 2013;159(6):411--420."]

. A phase III randomized clinical trial funded in 2015 by the VA Cooperative
Studies Program to investigate the optimal treatment for early stage operable
lung cancer [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02984761[VALOR:
NCT02984761]].

. A partnership announced in 2016 to create the Applied Proteogenomics
Organizational Learning and Outcomes consortium (APOLLO), in collaboration with
the Department of Defense and the National Cancer Institute, as part of the
wider National Cancer Moonshot
Initiative.footnoteref:["6",https://www.cancer.gov/research/key-initiatives/moonshot-cancer-initiative/milestones/nci-activities[].]

As these recent developments demonstrate, leaders and caregivers within the VA
are highly motivated and committed to further improving the quality of care for
Veterans with lung cancer.

[[sect-2]]
=== 2. Statement of Need

**Veterans represent a population that is at a particularly high risk for
developing lung cancer.** This is because millions of soldiers have served in
complex work environments that increased their rates of smoking and exposures
to carcinogenic chemicals. A recent query of the VA Cancer Cube demonstrates
that 77,930 Veterans were diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer between
2006--2015 (VA{nbsp}Cancer Cube, accessed [nowrap]##January 15,
2017##). Unfortunately, the majority{nbsp}(58%) presented with advanced
[nowrap]##stage III--IV## disease, which as shown below is often incurable and
carries a [nowrap]##5-year## overall survival rate of only
2--13%.footnoteref:["7","Williams CD, Gajra A, Ganti AK, Kelley MJ. Use and
impact of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with resected non-small cell lung
cancer. __Cancer.__ 2014;120(13):1939--1947."]

[[figure-1]]
[role="center"]
.**Survival rates goes down with stage.** The 4-year survival rate of Veterans diagnosed with stage I--IV lung cancer within the VA, by year of diagnosis (latexmath:[\(n = 48.844\)]).footnoteref:[7]
image::four-year-survival.png[]

**When patients present with more advanced disease, their treatments aren’t
just less effective, they are also more toxic.** For example, when lung tumors
are detected latexmath:[\(<2\,\hbox{cm}\)], they can often be removed with a
limited sublobar resection instead of a lobectomy which is required for larger
tumors.footnoteref:["8","Wisnivesky JP, Henschke CI, Swanson{nbsp}S,
et{nbsp}al. Limited resection for the treatment of patients with stage{nbsp}IA
lung cancer. __Ann Surg.__ 2010;251(3):550--554"] They can alternatively be
treated with outpatient stereotactic radiotherapy, which offers a
[nowrap]##3-year## survival rate of over 90%.footnoteref:["9","Chang JY, Bezjak
A, Mornex F. Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy for centrally located early
stage non-small-cell lung cancer: what we have learned. __J{nbsp}Thorac
Oncol.__ 2015;10(4):577--585."] Yet, since lung cancer is initially
asymptomatic, patients who are not screened often have delayed access to care
and present with more advanced disease that has invaded or spread to other
organs. When this occurs, treatment options are not only less effective, but
also more toxic as they typically include systemic chemotherapy and/or
radiotherapy with treatment fields that are much larger (see
<<figure-2,Figure{nbsp}2>>).

[[figure-2]]
[role="center"]
.**The toxicity of radiotherapy treatments goes up with stage.** Radiotherapy treatment plans for a patient with [nowrap]##(A) stage I##, and [nowrap]##(B) stage III NSCLC##.
image::toxicity-of-radiotherapy.png[]

**A structured lung cancer screening program can save many lives, beyond the
20% reduction in mortality from lung cancer demonstrated in the landmark
National Lung Screening Trial (NLST).** It is widely believed that the
magnitude of mortality reduction with LCS is 20%.footnoteref:["10","National
Lung Screening Trial Research{nbsp}T, Aberle{nbsp}DR, Adams{nbsp}AM,
et{nbsp}al. Reduced lung-cancer mortality with low-dose computed tomographic
screening. __N{nbsp}Engl{nbsp}J{nbsp}Med__##. 2011;365(5):395--409."] However,
this is likely an underestimation of the magnitude of the potential the true
gains of LCS since that trial was limited to only 3 rounds of screening with 5
years of follow up. The full benefit of screening becomes manifest only when
screening continues over many rounds, which was not possible in the context of
a trial such as NLST.footnoteref:["11","Yankelevitz DF, Smith JP. Understanding
the core result of the National Lung Screening
Trial. __N{nbsp}Engl{nbsp}J{nbsp}Med.__## 2013;368(15):1460--1461."] It is
important to note that the NLST was not designed to measure the magnitude of
the benefit from continued screening, instead it was designed to test the
hypothesis of whether screening with CT led to a mortality reduction compared
with screening with chest radiography. Thus, it was successful to have met this
endpoint, but by no means should that success be thought of as an accurate
measurement of the true potential benefit.  Additional important factors that
reduce the mortality of lung cancer relate to critical elements in the clinical
workflow that were unavailable for patients randomized in the NLST study. These
include a structured protocol for managing abnormal findings, quality oversight
of LDCT interpretations, a dedicated navigator to ensure timely transition from
diagnosis to treatment, access to a thoracic oncology multidisciplinary team,
and continuous real-time feedback from a management system.  As shown in
<<figure-3,Figure{nbsp}3>> below, these elements, which are all a component of
the [nowrap]##I-ELCAP## protocol to be introduced into select VA facilities by
this project, can result in outcomes that are unmatched by that reported in the
NLST trial.footnoteref:["12","Yip R, Henschke CI, Yankelevitz DF, Boffetta P,
Smith{nbsp}JP, International Early Lung Cancer{nbsp}I. The impact of the
regimen of screening on lung cancer cure: a comparison of I{nbhy}ELCAP
and{nbsp}NLST. __Eur{nbsp}J Cancer Prev.__ 2015;24(3):201--208."]

[role="center"]
.**Lung cancer screening program with a structured protocol is associated with further gains in survival than that demonstrated in the NLST.** This comparison of lung cancer specific survival between the patients diagnosed with stage I NSCLC in the I-ELCAP and NSLT protocols reveals the potential magnitude of benefit when a structured LCS protocol is established to guide elements of LDCT acquisition, image interpretation, and a clinical management workflow that ensures the timely transfer of patients from diagnosis to treatment. LDCT: low dose computed tomography. (__Adapted from Yip, Henschke, Yankelevitz et{nbsp}al, 2015.__{hairsp})footnoteref:[12]
image::survival-with-screening.png[]

**Lung cancer screening programs can be complicated.** On face value, it
appears that offering LCS to all high-risk Veterans might be uniformly
beneficial.  However, it is widely recognized that there can be harms if a
large scale LCS program is poorly implemented.footnoteref:["13","de Koning HJ,
Meza R, Plevritis SK, et{nbsp}al. Benefits and harms of computed tomography
lung cancer screening strategies: a comparative modeling study for the
U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. __Ann Intern Med.__
2014;160(5):311--320."] Similar to the experience in breast cancer screening
with mammography, there are complex evidence-based clinical algorithms that
must be followed when interpreting images to avoid the risks of unnecessary
diagnostic procedures. A careful look at the NLST study, for example, reveals
that even in the context of a closely monitored clinical trial, there can be up
to a two-fold range in difference among radiological interpretations of LDCT
scans given the nuances of abnormal findings.footnoteref:["14","Gierada DS,
Pilgram TK, Ford M, et{nbsp}al. Lung cancer: interobserver agreement on
interpretation of pulmonary findings at low-dose CT screening. __Radiology.__
2008;246(1):265--272."] These challenges were also seen when the VA studied the
feasibility of a LCS program through an 8-site demonstration
project.footnoteref:["4"] With a limited budget, and tight study period between
2013--15, it sought to investigate the logistics of implementing a wide-scale
LCS program in the VA. It too found wide variability, notably demonstrating a
[nowrap]##3-fold## difference in abnormal finding between sites (31--85%); this
was more than double what is commonly reported in the literature. As the
authors of the report suggested, standardization of radiological
interpretations would have likely reduced this value, perhaps below 20%.

An additional source of variability that can complicate large scale LCS
programs regards how patients are approached and consented when recommended
screening LDCT scans. The VA demonstration project provided insights into these
sorts of challenges as well. The percent of Veterans who agreed to be screened
ranged between 37--65%, depending on the medical center that was making the
recommendation. This highlights the need to continuously improve the shared
decision making processes that are used to invite patients for screening,
particularly for those with poor health literacy who may misinterpret the risk
to benefit ratio. In fact, the process of shared decision in regard to
understanding the balance of benefit to risk ratio in screening can be quite
challenging. The approach commonly taken has been to present the mortality
result of NLST as representing the potential benefit.  However, this approach
is highly misleading as it does not reflect the true benefit that would occur
with continued rounds of screening. Nor does it consider the impact on an
individual and their family when considering that a lung cancer that would
otherwise be fatal within a few years could have actually been cured, if found
early.

**Structured informatics systems are essential to facilitate the complex
coordination of care needed to safely track abnormal findings in a LCS
program.** This was one of the major conclusions from the VA demonstration
project. The VA currently has several independently developed lung nodule
tracking systems running in different regions across the country to assist
clinicians who are engaged in{nbsp}LCS. As a testament to the will of its
clinicians to establish new LCS programs, manually operated systems in
the{nbsp}VA have been developed with local resources using homegrown Microsoft
Excel spreadsheets and Microsoft Access databases. Centralized engineering
centers within the{nbsp}VA have helped to map the data from these local systems
for data aggregation and reporting, a process which was used to report the
results of the{nbsp}VA{nbsp}LCS demonstration project.footnoteref:[3] Over
time, clinicians have eventually become accustomed to these systems, though all
users surveyed during the development of this proposal were encouraged by the
opportunity for improvements (personal communication). It was shared that each
of these solutions have their own shortcomings, and are considered to be
labor-intensive and cumbersome to use.

Meanwhile, a more important shortcoming that remains is that none of these
systems communicates directly with VA’s electronic health record system
(VistA). This lack of VistA integration misses the opportunity to automate many
of the manual processes to reduce the burden of increased clinical workflow. It
also misses an opportunity for information technology scalability, as each of
these management systems have been set up in parallel databases and as such are
not designed for this purpose. This latter issue underlies a fundamental
challenge for VA to develop a nationwide LCS program in the near future.

**The VA is unable right now to support a national LCS program.** Ultimately,
the final results of the VA demonstration project were recently published in
January{nbsp}2017, and revealed that the{nbsp}VA is not currently ready to
launch a wide scale LCS program at this time.footnoteref:[3] It concluded that
there was too much variability between{nbsp}VA facilities with the limited
resources available, and that the management of large cohorts of patients
undergoing screening can be difficult with the current tools available. As a
result, the{nbsp}VA remains without centralized program to support lung cancer
screening at all of its{nbsp}150 medical centers. A recent survey reported that
clinicians at almost all{nbsp}VA facilities are aware of the missed opportunity
to save lives with{nbsp}LCS, yet only 26% are ideally prepared to offer this
service at this time.footnoteref:["15","Tukey MH, Clark JA, Bolton R,
et{nbsp}al. Readiness for Implementation of Lung Cancer Screening. A National
Survey of Veterans Affairs Pulmonologists. __Ann Am Thorac Soc.__
2016;13(10):1794--1801."] A few{nbsp}VA facilities are offering their support
as resources may allow, but the vast majority of providers in the{nbsp}VA are
currently left to develop their own{nbsp}LCS program without structured
supervision or support.

**The proposed strategic partnership between BMSF and VA offers a tremendous
opportunity to fulfill an unmet need for thousands of Veterans at risk for lung
cancer.** That’s because the{nbsp}VA has numerous resources and infrastructure
already in place to expand preventive services and care for patients with lung
cancer. However, at a time when resources are constrained for the development
of new projects in cancer care within the{nbsp}VA, and an absence of a
centralized program to supervise the implementation of numerous{nbsp}LCS
programs, such an opportunity appears to be in the distant future. Fortunately,
the alignment of{nbsp}BMSF with lung cancer experts within and outside
the{nbsp}VA offers an ideal opportunity to accelerate the diffusion of{nbsp}LCS
programs to improve the quality of care and save the lives of thousands of
Veterans. It also helps fulfill the call to action to address a malignancy that
kills over{nbsp}7,000 Veterans each year. It capitalizes on an evidence-based
preventive service that can save more lives than any other initiative in
oncology, given the magnitude of premature deaths from lung cancer exceeds the
next{nbsp}5 cancers combined. It also helps address a public health dilemma
that is commonly ignored due to the stigma of smoking, represented by the major
disparities in funding for lung cancer research that are only 1/10th and 1/20th
of resources available for prostate and breast cancer research, respectively.

[[sect-3]]
=== 3. Executive Summary

**This project is designed to increase Veterans’ access to LCS, increase the
likelihood of early detection, and ultimately reduce the mortality rate of lung
cancer.** To achieve this goal, it will implement a comprehensive LCS patient
management system at{nbsp}10{nbsp}VA medical centers through a partnership
between [nowrap]##I-ELCAP##, the VistA Expertise Network, the VA Center for
Innovation, and the VA National Teleradiology Program. It brings together
dozens of experts in thoracic oncology, radiology, medical imaging, and
healthcare information technology to establish a “think tank” that can oversee
its progress. The primary goals are to increase Veterans’ access to an
evidence-based LCS patient management system that can be easily diffused
throughout the VA. This will help increase the probability that Veterans
diagnosed with lung cancer are found at an earlier stage and can receive
treatments that are less toxic, and more likely to be curative. It will be
called the VA{nbhy}ELCAP system to highlight its customized development for
the{nbsp}VA’s healthcare environment. The secondary goals are to analyze the
implementation and performance of the VA{nbhy}ELCAP management system to guide
future expansion of{nbsp}LCS services for all Veterans who at risk of dying
prematurely from lung cancer.

**The I-ELCAP group was selected as the lead partner for this project because
of their{nbsp}25{nbsp}years of experience overcoming many of the obstacles and
challenges that any new LCS program may face.** It is also because of its focus
on disease management processes.footnoteref:["16","Mulshine JL, Henschke

Program was born out of the original ELCAP which was founded in{nbsp}1992 at
Cornell University and is now centered at Mt{nbsp}Sinai Hospital in New York
City. It was established by Dr.{nbsp}Claudia Henschke who is an international
leader in{nbsp}LCS, and a co{nbhy}PI for this project. I{nbhy}ELCAP has
successfully implemented new{nbsp}LCS programs at over{nbsp}70 healthcare
institutions worldwide, establishing it as the most experienced group in the
world. Their processes provide continuous oversight for each center, and as a
result the I{nbhy}ELCAP team has developed the world’s largest LCS registry
with over{nbsp}75,000 patients enrolled globally. This has offered a vast
database of clinical data that has resulted in over{nbsp}270 scientific
publications that have primarily focused on improving the quality and safety of
LCS.footnoteref:["17","Henschke CI, Li K, Yip R, Salvatore M, Yankelevitz

International Conference on Screening for Lung Cancer which continues to bring
together LCS experts from around the world at 6{nbhy}month intervals to discuss
ongoing improvements for this evidence-based preventive service.

**Additional partnerships to facilitate the successful integration of the
I{nbhy}ELCAP management system into the VA will include the VistA Expertise
Network (VEN), the VA{nbsp}National Teleradiology Program, and the
VA{nbsp}Center for innovation.** As described in the section below on
“<<sect-9,Collaborating Partners>>”, these partnerships will help provide the
necessary expertise and resources needed to address anticipated, and
unanticipated, hurdles in this project that may be unique whenever introducing
a new clinical pathway into the{nbsp}VA.

**There are two (2) aims to this project, which is designed to increase
Veterans’ access to LCS, increase the likelihood of early detection, and reduce
the mortality rate of lung cancer.**

* **Aim 1: Implement the evidence-based I{nbhy}ELCAP screening program
  [nowrap]##at 10 VA## medical centers through a process that includes
  training, oversight, and centralized quality assurance.** It will be
  supervised by leadership at I{nbhy}ELCAP, who have decades of experience
  introducing LCS programs at various healthcare institutions. As detailed
  below in <<sect-4,section{nbsp}4>>, it will be integrated directly into the
  VA’s electronic healthcare record system to simplify the clinical workflow of
  LCS and facilitate timely transition from diagnosis to treatment under the
  supervision of a thoracic oncology multi-disciplinary team. Implementation
  procedures at each VA medical center will focus on training, ensuring the
  quality of LDCT image acquisition, interpretation, and reporting of findings,
  and patient management processes. A centralized QA program will be developed
  to help with oversight. Once established, structured clinical data will be
  reviewed to monitor interpretations and local decisions that are made along
  the continuity of care by both navigators and radiologists. This will help
  reduce the harms that can emerge whenever clinical decisions diverge from
  protocol recommendations for patient selection, image interpretation, and
  management recommendation. This real-time evaluation process is ultimately
  designed to stay ahead of the historical challenges of workflow overload and
  unnecessary procedures that typically emerge in unsupervised LCS
  programs.footnoteref:["25","Xu DM, Lee IJ, Zhao S, et{nbsp}al. CT screening
  for lung cancer: value of expert review of initial baseline screenings. __AJR
  Am J{nbsp}Roentgenol.__ 2015;204(2):281--286."]

* **Aim 2: A formal evaluation of the 10 nascent VA{nbhy}ELCAP patient
  management systems will measure the impact of increasing Veterans access
  to{nbsp}LCS, rates of earlier detection, and opportunity for mortality
  reduction.** This project will also place particular emphasis on studying
  the processes required to implement this program within the{nbsp}VA’s
  healthcare environment. It will study its strengths and weaknesses of the
  VA{nbhy}ELCAP management system to assess the efficacy and safety of
  identifying at-risk patients, process of offering{nbsp}LCS, and managing
  their findings. The results of this analysis will be made available to help
  guide future clinical management decisions, and policy. This need is
  critical, given there remains a community of clinicians who believe the
  harms of screening may often outweigh the benefits.footnoteref:["26","Bach

  are concerns that may have only been strengthened by the{nbsp}VA{nbsp}LCS
  demonstration project which concluded that it might be too
  complicated. Thus, high quality scientific data are needed to better
  evaluate the value of{nbsp}LCS within the{nbsp}VA, particularly as
  scientific findings from the{nbsp}VA are commonly referenced to guide
  healthcare policy around the world.

**The potential benefit to the global lung cancer community.** Once completed,
this project will have increased access to{nbsp}LCS and have helped raise
further awareness about smoking cessation for thousands of Veterans at
the{nbsp}10{nbsp}sites included in this project. Results from the formal
evaluation described below can be viewed upon not only for internal VA policy
decisions, but also non-VA providers who are also interested in developing a
large scale LCS program. While the main advantage of this project is to benefit
Veterans cared for in the{nbsp}VA, it is important to recognize that this
project will also have an opportunity for an even broader global impact on the
lung cancer community. That’s because the VistA integration component of this
project will offer an agile system that can be diffused to dozens of additional
healthcare institutions around the world. VistA is an open source electronic
healthcare record software system that is extensively used by commercial and
government healthcare providers including healthcare providers in Texas,
Arizona, Florida, Hawaii, New Jersey, Oklahoma, West Virginia, New York,
Washington, D.C., and California. The addition of{nbsp}LCS services to VistA
also has the potential to support American Indians and Alaska Natives. This
includes the US Indian Health Service (IHS) which uses core VistA software
elements in a closely related EHR called RPMS, and manages the health of
approximately 1.8{nbsp}million American Indians and Alaska Natives who belong
to more than{nbsp}557 federally recognized tribes in 35{nbsp}states. In
addition, VistA is used at numerous international healthcare institutions
including the World Health Organization, the country of Jordan, and healthcare
sites in Mexico, Samoa, Finland, Germany, Kenya, Nigeria, Egypt, Malaysia,
India, Brazil, Pakistan, and Denmark.

=== 4. Target Population

A total of 10 VA medical centers were carefully selected for this project that
currently do not have a structured LCS program. To identify geographic areas
that care for a high volume of patients with NSCLC, the selection process
considered the unique geographic distribution of lung cancer rates among
Veterans which does not directly overlap with conventional epidemiological
data, given Veterans are not uniformly spread across the US (see
<<figure-4,Figure{nbsp}4>>).

The VA Cancer Cube was used to identify a list of VA medical centers that
manage a high number of Veterans with newly diagnosed{nbsp}NSCLC. Next, centers
were selected that had advanced diagnostic services in pulmonology, radiology,
and pathology. Each medical center was also confirmed to have timely access to
minimally invasive thoracic surgery, stereotactic radiotherapy, and medical
oncology to facilitate a smooth transition from diagnosis to the potential for
cure, given the known reduction in benefits of early detection whenever there
are delays to treatment (see <<figure-5,Figure{nbsp}5>>).

.**Delays from diagnosis to treatment reduces the benefits of early detection.** The forthcoming 8th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system has identified that the survival probability of NSCLC progressively declines with every millimeter of tumor growth that can result from delays in initiating treatment.

The final selection criteria of sites required the identification of a strong
clinician at each VA medical center who agreed to serve as a local champion for
this project. This resulted in a list of medical centers that were
coincidentally all affiliated with an academic institution. Additional services
that were identified at each included active smoking cessation programs as well
as services for case management, social work, and mental health.
