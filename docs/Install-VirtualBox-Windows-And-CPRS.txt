Install VirtualBox
    Mac
        Paste the following link into a browser: http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/5.1.28/VirtualBox-5.1.28-117968-OSX.dmg.
        
        Double-click the DMG file and follow the instructions.
        
    Linux
        Follow the instructions for your flavor at https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads.
        
    Install the Extension Pack
        Paste the following link into a browser: http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/5.1.28/Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-5.1.28-117968.vbox-extpack.
        
        Double-click the file. You must already have VirtualBox installed.
        
Build a Windows 10 virtual machine
    Go to https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/. Select the MSEdge on Win10 (x64) Stable virtual machine. Select the VirtualBox platform. Download the ZIP file.
    
    Mac
        The downloaded archive (ZIP file) will not open properly if you just double-click it. Install The Unarchiver (https://theunarchiver.com/) and use it to unpack the archive. After you've installed The Unarchiver, you can right-click on the archive, select Open With, and select The Unarchiver.
    
    Start VirtualBox. From the menu bar click File, click Import Appliance, and select the file "MSEdge - Win10_preview.ova" from wherever you unpacked the ZIP file.
    
    I usually specify a few details in the settings for the virtual machine, but you can take the defaults and start it. The Windows login password is "Passw0rd!".
    
    Click the yellow, folder icon in the task bar to open Windows Explorer. Navigate to "This PC". Under "Devices and drives", you should see "CD Drive (E:) VirtualBox Guest Additions". If you don't see it, restart your virtual machine and come back to this point. Double-click the VirtualBox Guest Additions and follow the instructions.
    
    Restart your virtual machine. I use the power options in the Windows Menu, but you can also use the controls provided in the VirtualBox Manager. The Guest Additions should produce a much more well-behaved virtual machine whose window can be resized and that doesn't capture your mouse.
    
Install CPRS
    CPRS must be installed on your virtual machine; it only runs on Windows.
    
    Paste the following links into a browser to download the ZIP files:
        http://foia-vista.osehra.org/Patches_By_Application/CPRS%20GUI%20FILES/CPRS%20VERSION%2030c/OR_30_423_scrubbed.zip
        http://foia-vista.osehra.org/Patches_By_Application/CPRS%20GUI%20FILES/CPRS%20VERSION%2030c/OR_30_423_SRC_scrubbed.zip
    
    Expand both ZIP archives. OR_30_423_scrubbed contains CPRSChart.exe; copy it to your desktop. OR_30_423_SRC_scrubbed includes the directory CPRS-chart, which includes the file borlndmm.dll; copy it to your desktop as well.
    
    Next you need to determine what IP address to use when connecting CPRS to Vista. In the Windows search field type "cmd" and select Command Prompt. At the prompt (C:\Users\IEUser>) type "ipconfig". Copy or remember the ethernet adapter default gateway IP address.
    
    Double-click CPRSChart.exe to start CPRS. On the Connect To panel, click New. Enter the IP address from the previous step and port 9430. Use the following credentials or those of your own CPRS-enabled Vista user:
        Access Code: FakeDoc1
        Verify Code: 1Doc!@#$
