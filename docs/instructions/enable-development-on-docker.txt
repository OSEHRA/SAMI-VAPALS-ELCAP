Altering one of our Docker containers for development -- enabling the ability to push to our repos -- is straightforward. You need make a few, simple changes as the osehra user.

Edit .bashrc

    $ docker start vapals
    $ ssh -p 2222 root@localhost
    (password is "docker")
    $ oshera
    
    The file includes the following section:

    # Git
    export GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="Alexis Carlson"
    export GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="whatisthehumanspirit@gmail.com"
    export GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="Alexis Carlson"
    export GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="whatisthehumanspirit@gmail.com"

    Replace my Git credentials with your own.

Replace the keys contents of the files id_rsa and id_rsa.pub with your own private and public keys. Then contact someone from VEN or OSEHRA and ask them to make you a collaborator for the OSEHRA/VA-PALS repo.
