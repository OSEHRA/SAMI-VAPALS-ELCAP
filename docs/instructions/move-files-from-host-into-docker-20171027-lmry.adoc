From terminal, change directory to where the files reside on your computer.
Type:  sftp -P 2222 root@localhost
You will then get an sftp> prompt in the docker container
Input the password
Then change directory to where you want the files in the instance, Perhaps:
cd /home/osehra/run/routines
Once there type: put filename
A list of the files you uploaded should scroll through.
Type: exit to go out of sftp and be returned to your original directory.
