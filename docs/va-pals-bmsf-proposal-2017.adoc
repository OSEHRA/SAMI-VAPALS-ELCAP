Via Rick: ``Here's the final draft proposal for the VA-PALS project, the one
that won the grant award. Although the VA-PALS official start date is likely to
be 1{nbsp}July, I'd like to take advantage of the time ahead of that start date
to bring us all (including me) up to speed so we can hit the ground running. We
have a lot to learn, but the first step is obvious: assessing what we agree to
do for this grant money.''
