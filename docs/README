This documentation directory is set up as a git submodule.

If you're not familiar with how submodules work, this will seem weird.
See the README in the parent directory for more information.

Note that CMakeLists.txt is used when building the website, and shouldn't be
changed without some knowledge of what you're doing. Fortunately, this
knowledge is easy to come by; just ask Ken for enlightenment, and it will be
bestowed unto you.
